# openlang
  This project focuses on creating innovative solutions that can help people learn different languages interactively

## Why?
  Education is the key to the development of individuals, households, communities and societies. Low levels of education and poor skill acquisition hamper economic growth. UNESCOâ€™s global education monitoring report, 2017-18 reports 264 million children and youth not going to school. Achieving universal primary and secondary attainment in the adult population would help lift more than 420 million out of poverty, notes another publication. A whooping 758 million adults lack any literacy skills of which two-third are women. 69 million new teachers are needed by 2030 to achieve education goals. Developing countries as of India contribute to the largest part of it. Add to it the quality of education being imparted, the woes turn worse. 
  Communication is the base of any education further, students struggling with it need personal assistance and guidance.
