# openlang
  This project focuses on creating innovative solutions that can help people learn different languages interactively

## Why?
  Schools with one English teacher for two hundred students!  
  Poor education standards at public schools in developing countries!  
  Children from lower strata of the society ending up illiterate and subsequently jobless because of their financial conditions!

  Or if YOU could learn languages at ease without actually going to a language school!

## What?
  A platform to learn a language of choice irrespective of learner's first language.  
  Free and open source!

## How?
  English to be the first use case, no restrictions on first language.  
  A carefully crafted set of stages for English learning right from the Alphabets.  
  Evolving with learner's speed.  
  Harnessing the prowess of Google's speech recognition APIs.
